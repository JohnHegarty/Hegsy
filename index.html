    <h1><center>Personal Information</center></h1>


    <p><center>My name is <strong>John Hegarty </strong> my student ID number is <strong>s3795094</strong></center></p>
    <p><center>Born and raised in Australia, with a sligh touch of german passed down from my great grand father.
     I've been passionate about IT ever since I started playing 2D Runescape Classic in early 2000's then late 2006 I took
     classes at school for IT, Recently did 6 months of Software development at tafe.</center></p>
					
    <p><center>I'm also a huge of sport.. particularly fan of soccer! I play myself.. My biggest sporting hero is Cristiano Ronaldo</center></p>

    <h2><center>Interest in IT</center></h2>
			<p><center>My interests in IT began around the age of 10 when I found a 2D game by the name of RSC ( Runescape Classic ) it made me always ask myself on how the inner working’s of the game worked, from the client logging to level skill’s, to being on the highscores for skills I had been training for those my hours per day as child. 
				I have never have the chance to act on my love for it and now I have the chance to chase a career that I have been so eager to enter for so long.</center></p>
      			<p><center>My interest in IT are Back-end or Front-end development, I know basic's of some programming languages and now Im back studying to expand my knowledge along with learning and excelling at new technologies and allow myself to be creative at problem solving and learning new/advanced languages.</center></p>
			<p><center>I chose RMIT after alot of forum hoping and google searches etc, I visit whirlpool forums often and started digging around to find out how RMIT was run, Trying to find how efficient the College was, were people happy with how it was run and classes were taught. And I have to say 90% of the people posting or adding inputs about RMIT as a college were great which lead me to applying.</center></p>
			<p><center>Im extremely eager to learn about coding, coding has always be fascinating to me, how some can create such programs and a device is able to run those pieces of complex code. Along side coding I'm also hoping I can learn about databases (SQL) as they go hand in hand along with self learning for optimal growth and least to say I'm extremely excited to see where my study and self learning leads me too.</center></p>

            <h2><center>Ideal Job</center></h2>

            <a href="Images/Capture3.JPG"><img class="seek-photo" src="Images/Capture3.JPG"></a>

            <p>This is my ideal job because it has so many different types of technology involved and I can always be up-to-date with the latest I.T trends such as design network with Cisco router and switches, using the latest windows server editions and windows products, VMWare ESXi models and hyper-v designs.</p>

            <p ALIGN=LEFT>To gain this position I would need to have a number of years experience with troubleshooting I.T problems, Designing I.T solutions and a degree with a number of certifications including CCNA, MCSE and also good customer facing charisma.</p>

            <p>I have already studied an advanced diploma of computer systems engineering which I hope allows me to gain credits from my degree. I also have an expired CCENT and Exam 70-410/Course 20410 certification. I plan to upgrade the CCENT to a CCNA and to complete 2 other MSCA exam to gain a full MSCA certificate, as for experience I have work a lot with backup systems such as windows backup, azure backup and Veeam. I have also worked with both current and older version of windows and windows server from 2003 to 2016 other technologies include Sonicwalls, Cisco, Connectwise, exchange on premises and office 365 and many more.</p>

            <p>To achieve the skills needed to reach this job position I would need to continue to work in the I.T industry but maybe move to a more hardware/software position to gain more experience with the technologies used today, I would also have to complete this degree and renew my CCNA certificate and finish 2 more Microsoft certifications. Exam 70-411/Course 20411 and Exam 70-412/Course 20412.</p>

            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>

            <p>The results to these test's was a bit surprising to me as i always saw myself as an introvert and the 16 personalities test shows that I am an extrovert and that I need to work with hands on projects, things like learning coding by doing instead of just reading a book or watching a video about then subject. the third test shows that i work well in a team but not as a leader and need some direction before starting a new idea.</p>

            <p> After doing these 3 tests i believe i need to speak up for about my ideas in a team and not just do what the group agrees to just to save from having an argument or a conflict, I believe that I would work best in a smaller team then a larger team as i like to get to know my team members before trusting them, I would also benefit from having team member that are not like me and have a more visual and Audible approach to a problem.</p>

            <p>With the results from these test I would look for team members that are good at taking the lead on a project but also allow me to use my skills and idea's to create something that i think is meaningful to work on. i would also look for team members that I can trust and can help me with areas that I lack in.</p>

                <h2><center>Project Idea</center></h2>

                <p><center>My project would be a robot that for large warehouses that contain chemicals the robot would be able to Detect spills, along with being able to test area's for high level of dangerous admissions along with blockages that may stop the robot's given path in the area that it is monitoring. For this a sever sending updates how ever often the client wishes along with warning's/updates sent via email and via smart phone app to avoid any unnecessary exposure.</center></p>

                <p><center>This would be extremely useful not only for reducing the possible harm to human life but allowing for monitoring of spaces 24/7 with the click of button and updating the given information to any user.
This will also allow for more necessary work to be carried out in other places that human interaction is required.
Allowing for more work turnover along with saving money and time as-well as human interaction in places that may be exposed to hazardous gases.</p>


                <p><center>The features of the robot as mentioned are as followed.
Allowing the robot to measure for gases in abnormal ranges, Along with spills of hazardous substances and also warning users of blockages of the robots path for that given area.

The hardware requirements for this project should be relatively straightforward, with a centralised server which has the capability of monitoring continuously and recording of all data.
I think it is important the hardware can have the time intervals between readings changed easily in case the user requires something different in the future. For robustness, any hardware must work on any operating system using MySQL open source code. The software must limit access to the centralised database to the location for security purposes. It is important to encrypt all data recorded to maintain the confidentiality of the locations and monitoring locations that will be clients.</p>

                <p><center>Information repositories such as expected readings for similar plants across the globe could be used in order to quickly identify any anomalies.
A centralized database so that all the information can be stored securely, but this must be limited to location so only authorised personnel are able to view the data. Security is of paramount importance because of the value of the data that is being recorded. To maintain this security, clients will only have read-only access, with authorised staff on your end being able to make any changes necessary.
It may be necessary to change the number of readings the robot makes (should there be a spike recorded, for example), so the database must be robust enough to cope with this.  Specific users to get alerts on phone about the robot readings and maintenance status, to ensure the smooth running of the recording.
Security is paramount, so a strict chain of command will be followed when dictating who will have access to the data, and who will be able to make certain changes to the equipment.</center></p>

                <p><center>Also with extra security module’s purchased because of the importance of the data that is being recorded. Malicious attempts to alter the data could lead to catastrophic consequences, which is why it is very important that only authorised personnel have the ability to make these changes to the system.</center></p>




                <p><center>The Skill’s required for this project would be a strong team of Database Analyst’s, Database Programmer’s, Database Tester’s and QA officer’s. Allowing for the program to not only be implemented but will critical testing of the database functionality this will ensure that the system never goes down and a great experience for the user’s and customer’s.

Some drawback’s are still possible even with certain thing’s in place
Including the price as-well as sever cost’s and the cost of adding more security and protection but mentioned open source is the best move to lower cost’s , there could as-well be unforeseen robots malfunction’s and issues with hardware with the AI, from replacing small part’s to completely rebuilding or replacing it.</center></p>

                <p><center>The benefits overall from this AI robot project is to prevent danger of human life allowing user to get accurate readings of substances and gases and allow man hour’s to be used more effectively else where.
Some possible negative out come’s although stated to prevent danger of human life another negative is replacing human life with AI resulting in loss of work, another negative I see if replacing/repairing of the robot’s which could be extremely costly.</center></p>
